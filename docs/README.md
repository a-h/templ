# Templ docs generator

To edit docs, edit the relevant markdown files in `docs/`.

To see your changes locally, run `npm run install`, then `npm run start`. 
You will need go, npm (installed from node), and [xc](https://xcfile.dev/getting-started/#installation) installed.

This will not watch for file changes, so when you make changes you will need to stop the server and run `npm run build` again.

To build the docs for production, `cd` into this directory, run `npm install`, then `npm run build`.
